# BTBadgeView

BTBadgeView is a view that replicates and extends the number badge UI element in iOS.

BTBadgeView is basically just a minor code improvement of Michael Kamprath's [MKNumberBadgeView](https://github.com/michaelkamprath/iPhoneMK/tree/master/Views/MKNumberBadgeView) to support string values instead of integers.

If you find any of these classes useful, I'd love to hear about it. If you have improvements for any of them, feel free to commit your changes. If you have any classes you would like to add to the collection, please provide them.

## ARC Support

BTBadgeView fully supports ARC.
